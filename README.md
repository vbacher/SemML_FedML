# Demonstration of a federated learning algorythm for the Seminar ML at the FAU

This little project is meant for demonstration purposes only.
The jupyter notebook contains two experiments, one for a cross silo and the second one in a cross device setting.
To execute both, please read the section before the two setting, adjust the parameters accoring to the comments and create the respective dataset.
To make the results reproducible please use the binder link below.
Note that since a environment including Pytorch needs to be created, the launch may take a while.
